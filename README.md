# Josephson-Junction-Simulation-Using-RCSJ-Model

This project aims at obtaining the I-V Chraracteristics of the Josephson Junction using the RCSJ Model. This program can also work on other current-phase relations and can be used to investigate non-reciprocity and hence the Josepshson Diode Effect.
